Bird-Sighting-iOS-App
=====================

A Master Detail iOS Application
-------------------------------

- App defines a model layer that includes both the data objects (Birds) that the app handles and the management of the data object.
- The app is based on the master-detail format, in which users select an item (Bird) in a master list to see details about the item in a secondary screen (Detail Screen).
- App uses storyboards to base it on this format and to send data to the detail screen for display.
- App also allows users to add a new item in the Master list by adding a new scene and embedding it in the navigation controller.
